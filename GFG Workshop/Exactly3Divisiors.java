/**
 * Instead of checking till n, we can check till √n because a larger factor of n
 * must be a multiple of smaller factor that has been already checked.
 * 
 * The algorithm can be improved further by observing that all primes are of the
 * form 6k ± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3. This is because all integers can
 * be expressed as (6k + i) for some integer k and for i = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4;
 * 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4); and 3 divides (6k + 3). So a more
 * efficient method is to test if n is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check
 * through all the numbers of form 6k ± 1.
